# Dreams

- A Python 3 version of PyPy as the default Python
- A *really smart* alternative to the false-dichotomy of static vs. dynamic typing
- A *really compelling* story for concurrent and parallel Python
- A *really simple* tool-chain for packaging, versioning and deploying
- A *really welcoming* community where diversity is the default
